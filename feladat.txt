Task: To create a submission view to submit the choice selections

Since you have created several new models, you need to import them at the top of the views.py, such as from .models import Course, Enrollment, Question, Choice, Submission

    Create a submit view def submit(request, course_id): to create an exam submission record for a course enrollment, you may implement it based on following logic:
        Get the current user and the course object, then get the associated the enrollment object (HINT: Enrollment.objects.get(user=..., course=...))
        Create a new submission object referring to the enrollment (HINT: Submission.objects.create(enrollment=...))
        Collect the selected choices from HTTP request object (HINT: you could use request.POST to get the payload dictionary, and get the choice id from the dictionary values, an example code snippet is also provided)
        Add each selected choice object to the submission object
        Redirect to a show_exam_result view with the submission id to show the exam result
        Configure urls.py to route the new submit view such as path('<int:course_id>/submit/', ...),

    Create an exam result view 
    
    def show_exam_result(request, course_id, submission_id): 
    
    to check if the learner passed exam as well as their question results. You may implement the view based on the following logic:

        Get the selected choice ids from the submission record
        For each selected choice, check if it is a correct answer or not
        Calculate the total score by adding up the grades for all questions in the course
        Add the course, selected_ids, and grade to context for rendering HTML page
        Configure urls.py to route the new show_exam_result view 
        such as path('course/<int:course_id>/submission/<int:submission_id>/result/', ...),
